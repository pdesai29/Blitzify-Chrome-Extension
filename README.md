### GitHub Integration with "Launch" Button:
<p>Blitzify enhances your GitHub experience by adding a convenient "Launch" button to GitHub repository pages. With a single click, you can instantly view, review, and run code from the repository on a running online development environment, without the need to download it to your local machine.

### I personally use it for testing npm packages or libraries, instead of starting IDE and downloading packages on a local machine, I use this extension.
